🚀 Loan Status Prediction
📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on applicant details. It uses machine learning (SVM - Support Vector Machine) to classify loan applications and provides insights into important factors affecting approval.

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains details such as:
✔ Applicant Income
✔ Coapplicant Income
✔ Loan Amount
✔ Credit History
✔ Dependents
✔ Marital Status, Education, and more

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
Joblib (Model Saving)
🔍 Data Preprocessing
Removed missing values
Converted categorical data to numerical values
Replaced labels (Y → 1, N → 0)
Normalized values for better training
🏆 Model Training
The model was trained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel. It was evaluated on both training and testing data to measure accuracy.
